# Wheat-CLassification-using-Dense-ANN



## Introduction:
This project utilizes the Seeds Dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset comprises 210 instances, each with 7 features. The objective of this project is to explore, analyze, and model the data to understand its characteristics and develop predictive models.

## Dataset Description:
- Source: [Seeds Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds)
- Instances: 210
- Features: 7
- Attributes: Area, Perimeter, Compactness, Length of Kernel, Width of Kernel, Asymmetry Coefficient, Length of Kernel Groove
- Target Variable: Variety of Wheat (Kama, Rosa, Canadian)

## Project Components:
1. **Data Exploration:** Analyzing the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships between features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and patterns to gain insights into the dataset.
4. **Modeling:** Building Dense Neural network models (e.g., classification algorithms) to predict the variety of wheat based on the input features.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy).


## File Structure:
- `seeds_dataset.csv`: Raw dataset file.
- `seeds_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project README file providing an overview of the project, dataset, and methodology.

## Instructions for Running the Notebook:
1. Ensure Python and required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras) are installed.
2. Download the `seeds_dataset.csv` file from the provided link and place it in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the `seeds_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to execute the analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.
